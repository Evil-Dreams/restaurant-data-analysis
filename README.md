# Restaurant Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on restaurant datasets to understand patterns related to ratings, pricing, and customer behavior.

Two restaurant datasets are loaded and merged to form a single dataset. The data is then explored using descriptive statistics and structural inspection to understand its shape, features, and distributions.

Python and Jupyter Notebook are used for analysis with Pandas for data handling. The project focuses on gaining insights from raw restaurant data rather than building predictive models.

This analysis can help restaurant owners, analysts, and businesses understand customer trends, pricing patterns, and overall restaurant performance.
